# LMS
Library Media System; University of New Haven - Fall 2020 - CSCI-1110-05

Thank you for using MEDKS Library Management System!

Default Admin User login info:

username = testname1

password = testpass1

The other .txt files will automatically be created when you use the LMS software.

To completely reset the LMS's databases to our defaults, delete every .txt file present in the directory
(except this one, unless you don't need to remember what's in here)

Also, it is recommended to resize the LMS window to increase its width, as displaying the library data can sometimes cause info to cut off onto the next line.
